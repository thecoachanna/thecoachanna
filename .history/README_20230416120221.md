### About Me:

Hi, I'm Anna! I'm a Software Engineering Intern at a stealth mode start-up and recent bootcamp graduate from General Assembly where I built a strong foundation in web development, including skills in modern front-end and back-end technologies.

I am currently gaining hands-on experience in my internship working with serverless architecture and cloud computing within AWS. Specifically building functions in Lambda and implementing AWS Simple Email Service within our React app.

As a lifelong learner, I'm excited by the ever-evolving field of software engineering and facing new challenges.

In 2023, I'm continuing to work hard in order to land my first full-time role as a Software Engineer and mentor other bootcamp graduates who are hoping to do the same.

### Projects:

<li><a href="https://workoutbuddy2.herokuapp.com/">WorkoutBuddy</a> - A web application that allows users to find fellow exercise enthusiasts in their area to meet up and workout with. It is a concept that is dear to me because of the difficulty I’ve experienced making friends in a new city and preferring to be active over just food + drinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://starting-strength-frontend.herokuapp.com/workouts/home">Starting Strength</a> - A 6 week workout program designed for true beginners to strength training including exercise videos, cues and a training tips page.</li>
<li><a href="https://thecoachanna.github.io/Matching-Game/">Exercise Matching Game</a> - A fun memory card matching game with a body diverse fitness theme.</li>
<br>
<p><em>In progress...</em></p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/thecoachanna/takehaction">Disabili-Buddy</a> - A project I had the opportunity to work on as part of Ada Developers Academy #TakeHaction Hackathon. Disabili-Buddy is an assistive tool designed to help disabled folx safely communicate with law enforcement. It is a project that I am really proud of because of its spotlight on mental health, inclusive design and support for the neurodivergent community.</li>
