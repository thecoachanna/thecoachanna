## Projects:

<li><a href="https://workoutbuddy2.herokuapp.com/">WorkoutBuddy</a> - Workout Buddy is a web application that allows users to find fellow exercise enthusiasts in their area to meet up and workout with. It is a concept that is dear to me because of the difficulty I’ve experienced making friends in a new city and preferring to be active over just food + drinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://starting-strength-frontend.herokuapp.com/workouts/home">Starting Strength</a> - This app is a 6 week workout program designed for true beginners to strength training including exercise videos, cues and a training tips page.</li>
<li><a href="https://thecoachanna.github.io/Matching-Game/">Exercise Matching Game</a> - </li>

<h3><em>In progress...</em></h3>

<li><a href="https://github.com/thecoachanna/takehaction">Disabili-Buddy</a> - Disabili-Buddy is a project I had the opportunity to work on as part of Ada Developers Academy #TakeHaction Hackathon. Disabili-Buddy is an assistive tool designed to help disabled folx safely communicate with law enforcement. It is a project that I am really proud of because of its spotlight on mental health, inclusive design and support for the neurodivergent community.</li>
